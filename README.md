# Etch a Sketch
This project is a summative for grade 12 computer engineering.
I worked on this project with 3 other people.
The project consisted of virtual and live demonstrations as well as
a software and hardware version of the project. We built the hardware
device using the Arduino C++ language along with the ESP32 to process
and power everything.
